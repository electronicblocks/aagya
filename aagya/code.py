This is a class that aims to make parsing a little bit easier.
It creates an abstraction layer between the parser and the
code string itself. This class will provide methods to
get characters from code, automatically removing whitespace,
and checking if there's anything wrong (Wrong syntax or
EOF while parsing)

	Abstraction layer between parsers and code string.
	The code is stored as a list of characters to make removing
	parsed characters easier.
	Every time a character is parsed, it will be removed from
	the list of characters. In this way, the character that's being
	parsed, or 'current character', is always the first one.
	This class implements methods to check what's the current character,
	and to parse a character (that removes it from the list).
	This class also implements method to get charaters until a
	certain one (e.g.: parse until the character is ").
	Whitespace is always ignored, except in "parse until [x]"
	methods, as spaces should be parsed in strings.
